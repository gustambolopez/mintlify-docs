**Open(ai) Sans** is a bespoke typeface developed for OpenAI’s brand refresh in early 2025, crafted in collaboration with in‑house design and external foundries. It merges geometric clarity with subtle humanistic warmth for example the outer ‘O’ is a perfect circle, whereas the inner shape is intentionally imperfect to soften the overall tone.

Open(ai)Sans is used as the core word‑mark and brand typeface across digital and print assets, designed with multiple weights (Light, Regular, Medium, Semibold, Bold) and corresponding italics. It aims to reflect the values of inclusivity, clarity, and technical excellence inherent to OpenAI’s mission.
