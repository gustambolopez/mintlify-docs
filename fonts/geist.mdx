**Geist** is a typeface crafted for developers by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), designers, and anyone who values clarity and precision. It began as a monospace font, designed to maximize readability and integrate seamlessly into coding and technical environments.

After refining the monospace variant, Geist expanded into a versatile sans-serif version, offering flexibility for a wide range of digital and web applications.

Built on principles of simplicity, minimalism, and speed, and inspired by the Swiss design tradition, Geist prioritizes precision, clarity, and functionality. It enhances the visual experience, helping users communicate ideas effectively through clean, modern typography.

With its thoughtful design and balanced aesthetics, Geist embodies the spirit of contemporary digital design practical, refined, and approachable.
