**Hugeicons** is a webready icon system offering over 40k icons across 9 distinct visual styles, covering everything from stroke icons to duotone and bulk versions.

It supports multiple workflows: you can embed via a cdn font stylesheet for html use, apply custom styles using css, and integrate with js frameworks or modules as needed.

**Using Hugeicons:**

### html

Embed the icon font via a cdn link in your `<head>` section:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.hugeicons.com/font/hgi‑stroke‑rounded.css" />
```

Then use icons with the `<i>` tag plus classes:

```html
<i class="hgi hgi‑stroke hgi‑user"></i>
```

### css

You can control size, color, and effects using css:

```css
.icon-md {
  font-size: 24px;
}
.icon-success {
  color: #10b981;
}
```

Icons inherit `color` and scale with `font-size`.
