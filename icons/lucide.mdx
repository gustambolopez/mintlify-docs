**Lucide** is a clean, consistent icon toolkit maintained by a community of designers and developers, offering over 1,600 icons. It’s designed for flexibility across html, css or js environments: you can embed icons directly in html using data attributes, you can style them with css (size, color, stroke width), and manipulate them via js(via apicalls such as `createIcons()`). It supports a “static” mode (raw svgs, sprites, icon fonts) for low or no js setups, as well as dynamic js usage for interactive web apps.

**Using Lucide on the web:**

Use a data attribute in an html tag to reference an icon name:

```html
<i data‑lucide="menu" class="iconidfk"></i>
```

Then include the Lucide script:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/lucide@latest/dist/umd/lucide.js"></script>
```

And call the init function:

```javascript
lucide.createIcons();
```
